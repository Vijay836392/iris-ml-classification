Iris Flower Classificaton Project
About ->

This project comprises a basic implementation of flower classification, utilizing the Iris dataset from the scikit-learn library.  The primary function is to predict the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its sepal length, sepal width, and petal measurements.

tthe  objective of this project was to gain familiarity with fundamental machine learning concepts, and to deploy a goood model. It is primarily intended as a learning exersize and may not be suitable for production thing.  However, contributions and improvements are welcome.

Installlation
To initiate use of this project, Python 3.12 is required.  It is strongly recomended that a virtual environment be employed.  A virtual environment can be established as follows:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux ,macOS systems
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows systems

Subsequently, the required dependancies can be installed via pip:
pip install -r requiremnts.txt

Usage
To utilize the classifier, execute the iris_classifier.py script from the command line.  Flower measurements should be provided as command-line arguments. 
The script will then output the predicted species of the iris flower.
